#write a function that reads a directory fully of files and reports the number of completely observed cases in each data file. the function should return a data fram where the first column is the name of the file and the second column is the number of complete cases

#use same import code from pollutantmean.R
#

complete <- function(directory, id){
	directory <- #this can probably come from the code of the first function#
	id <- #same here#
	#we need to read the data and make a matrix of results where the id and number of complete cases are the columns and the rows are the directories where this info is coming from
